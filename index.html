			<h2>Instructions</h2>

			<div class="instruction">
				<div class="cuadro">1</div>
				<p>
					Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to
					250°F (117°C)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="instruction">
				<div class="cuadro">2</div>
				<p>
					<strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the
					graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar
					and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together
					in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the
					bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform
					pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring
					cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove
					from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil.
					The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow
					crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="instruction">
				<div class="cuadro">3</div>
				<p>
					<strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer
					fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated
					sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture
					is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla
					extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium
					speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until
					just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter,
					stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and
					cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="instruction">
				<div class="cuadro">4</div>
				<p>
					<strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong> Boil a pot
					of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water
					bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot
					water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the
					springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a
					rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan
					inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of
					the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in
					the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for
					you.)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="instruction">
				<div class="cuadro">5</div>
				<p>
					Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set.
					When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if
					you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door
					slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it
					cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool
					cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the
					cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="instruction">
				<div class="cuadro">6</div>
				<p>
					Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
					springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut
					into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip
					into warm water between each slice.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="instruction">
				<div class="cuadro">7</div>
				<p>
					Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
					cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
